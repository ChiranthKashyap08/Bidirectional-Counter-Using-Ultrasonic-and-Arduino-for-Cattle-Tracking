# Bidirectional-Counter-Using-Ultrasonic-and-Arduino-for-Cattle-Tracking

## Overview

The objective is to propose IoT based Bidirectional Counter using Ultrasonic and Arduino for Cattle Domestication which will enable the cattle owner to keep a track of their cattle whenever it goes outside or come inside the shelter. 
A counter that can change its state in two directions. The circuit given here can be used to count the number of cattle entering to the shelter and to count the number of cattle exiting from the shelter. It displays the number of cattle entered and number of cattle exited and total number of cattle inside. It can also be used at main gate so that it can also count the number of people enter and exit.

## Hardware Requirements

* Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
* Ultrasonic sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
* Display module (e.g., LCD display or OLED display)
* I2C module
* Jumper wires
* Power supply (if required)
* Bread Board

## Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* Appropriate Arduino libraries for the ultrasonic sensors and display (e.g., NewPing library for ultrasonic sensors)
* A compatible computer with a USB port for programming the Arduino board
